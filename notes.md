<h2>5.1 Call to Action</h2>

<p>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.</p>

<p>Some beneficial effects of computig is that we can create programs that make carrying out tasks easier. databases with helpful and accesible information can be used to better inform society, it also can expand our possibilities through things such as simulations. But harmful effects might include people creating harmful programs, making personal information easily accesible, and simulations putting something bad into fruition.</p>

<p>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</p> 

<p>Dopamine issues are real. Games and social media sites are made to keep you hooked and interested in whatevr the game or website is. This can make distractions for students and workers and bring productivity down. Peronally I can get distracted by my phone when I should be doing work so I believe dopamine issues are real.</p>

<h2>5.2 Call to action</h2>

<p>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?</p>

<p>Someone can empower themselves in the digital world by reasearching and indulging themselves in things like coding and just finding out how computers and the digital world work.</p>

<p>How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.</p>

<p>Something I could do at DNHS to help empower someone is explain a problem they are having with technology or shw them something basic in programming that can be useful or helful in the digital world.</p>

<p>Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</p> 

<p>There are red tape blockings at Del norte like with CSP. A persnal laptop is neede because it is difficult and tie consuming to download things on the given school computers. The problem with this si that it means only people with good access to technology can take courses such as CSP to learn more about programming and how computers work. It can happen in other places as well when there are things blocking or preventing everyone from accesing the digital world and the opportunities it holds.</p>

<h2>5.3 Call to Action</h2>

<p>yes the owner does think it is intentional because if it was not intetonal he wuld nto have labeled it as racist. This likely happened tho because during development HP did not crowdsource for other people with different facial features ad skin tones to see if the software still worked on them. I believ it is harmful and should be corrected because everyone deserves to use the software regardless of skin tone or color. One group of people should not get to reap he benefits while others can not. I would fix this by testing the software on many people with different faces and skin tones to make sure it works for everyone.</p>

<h2>5.4 Call to Action</h2>

<p>CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?</p>

<p>A crowd source idea could be all of the students working collectively on a project or website. Parts could be split up between classes and classes could rotate between parts for input from everyone. This could be initistd by the teacher introducing it in every class and leaders in each class/group collaborating.</p>

<p>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?</p>

<p>Crowd sourcing in Del Norte can be something like ideas on school events ans spirit days and all spirit and school related activities. Crowdsourcing can be used ot get ideas from all students so we can cater to all interests and revent certain students or groupds from feeling left out. </p>

<h2>5.5 Call to Action</h2>

<p>Some Licenses</p>

<p>Creative commons: The work you create is open for anyone to use in anyway. It is public domian for the whole world.

  Open Source MIT:This allows using code freely but being able to selle and distribute a closed source version.

  GPL: Allows anything to be done to your code except closed source versions for distribution.
</p>

<p>Which one me and my team will be using</p>

<p>My team has been using GPL for everyone to be alble to use and the share the code because our group believes in sharing code. For that same reason I as well will be using GPL.</p>

<h2>5.6 Call to Action</h2>

<p>Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
  
  PII on COmpSci P has included maybe a feature asking for your age or on something like the greet function it asks you for your name.

  What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
  
  I believe PII is important because some websites need it and some places it is ok to give it people jus thave to be safe with it. I think personally I have done a good job keeping my PII low and safe and not giving away very personal or private info.

  Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
  
  Good passwords have a variety of characters, symbols, and numbers. They also arent simple words or phrases. Bad passwords are simple and not complex. A good password would be p@#!7ngk but a bad password would be 123456 or password.

  Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
  
  Symmetric encryption uses one secret key to encrypt and decrypt. While Asymmetric uses 2 keys. One public and one private key to encrypt or decrypt.

  Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
  
  We use asymmetrical encryption to keep unathorized changes from being made to the website.

  Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

  I have never fallen for a phishing scheme but I know many others that have fallen for a specific one where they click on a link sent to them by a friend. This link often says they have a gift and to claim it they have to put in their account name and password. The website will then use the info to keep the scheme going and attacking more people.
